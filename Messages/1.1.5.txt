New in version 1.1.5:
- Commandline argument confirmexit for Vice removed, since it seems to differ 
  between confirmexit and confirmonexit in different versions/distributions of Vice.
  Instead, you can easily remove the confirm exit dialog by configuring the default setting for Vice.
- Fixed a crash when staring debug without creating breakpoint file
