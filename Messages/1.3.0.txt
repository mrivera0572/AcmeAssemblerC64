New in version 1.3.0:
- New feature: Integrating the KickAss Tooltips pluign 
  Shows documentation when hovering over opcodes, vic-registers, sid-registers and some kick assembler directives.
  More documentation to come.
  Thanks to @brushesm (https://github.com/brushesm) and @ogt2 (https://github.com/og2t) for this.
- New feature: Default commands for C64Debugger
  Use of C64Debugger thru the kickass_run_path or kickass_debug_path settings 
  is now detected and a custom command is used to start C64Debugger.
  The command will use symbols and breakpoints (4.x breakpoints) from Kick Assembler, see note below.
  Thanks to @arekbr (https://github.com/arekbr) for suggestion and to @BroneCk (https://github.com/broneck) for help implementing
- New setting kickass_env to add environment variables when building
  These variables has precedence over other environment variables with the same names.
  Mostly useful for prebuild, postbuild and make commands
  Suggested by Tomek Augustyn (https://github.com/og2t)
  Details: https://github.com/Swoffa/SublimeKickAssemblerC64/issues/22
- A warnig is now shown if settings cannot be loaded when a build is requested, asking the user to restart Sublime.
  This should avoid some strange errors after updating, or switching between cloned and package control install modes.
- New settings for detailed customization of compile, run and debug commands:
  kickass_run_command_x64
  kickass_debug_command_x64
  kickass_debug_command_c64debugger
  kickass_run_command_c64debugger
  kickass_compile_args
  kickass_compile_debug_additional_args
  Hopefully I will write a more detailed blog post about this later, at https://goatpower.org/
  Thanks to @arekbr (https://github.com/arekbr) for suggestion and to @BroneCk (https://github.com/broneck) for help implementing
- Verified basic Kick Assembler 5 support (Kick Assembler 4.x still supported)
  Both old ( break() ) and new ( .break ) breakpoints can be used.
  Using the default segment works, better support for multi segment things will be added later. 
- Minor bug fixes and improvements

Note:
It is possible to use the new dbg-files created by Kick Assembler 5 in C64Debugger (version 0.64.56). 
Just add this setting to your user settings.
"kickass_args": "-debugdump" 
And C64Debugger will automatically load the dbg-file.

See http://goatpower.org for more details.
